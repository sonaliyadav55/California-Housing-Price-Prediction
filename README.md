# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

This Python project focuses on predicting house prices in California. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) to provide insights into the factors that influence house prices.
The project leverages popular data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.

Key Components

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extensive data exploration is performed to understand the dataset's structure and uncover trends and patterns in California housing data. 
This includes data cleaning, handling missing values.

2. Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visualizations that help in understanding the relationships between different variables and how they influence house prices.


*The dataset contains 20640 entries and 10 variables.

* Longitude
*Latitude
*Housing Median Age
*Total Rooms
*Total Bedrooms
*Population
*Households
